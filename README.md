# Resume Optimizer 📝

This project is an AI-powered Resume Optimization System built using CrewAI. It analyzes resumes, extracts key information, matches them with job descriptions, and suggests improvements to make resumes more relevant to job postings.

## 🚀 Features

- Parses resume text and extracts structured information.
- Analyzes job descriptions to identify key requirements.
- Validates the relevance of a resume to a specific job.
- Generates an optimized resume that aligns with the job requirements.
- Uses GPT-4o for accurate AI-powered resume enhancement.

## 🏷️ How It Works

1. **Upload Resume** – Users upload their resume in PDF format.
2. **Enter Job Description** – Users provide the job description they want to optimize for.
3. **AI Analysis** – The system extracts information from both the resume and job description.
4. **Resume Validation** – It determines if the resume matches the job.
5. **Resume Optimization** – If the match is valid, it rewrites the resume to highlight relevant experience.
